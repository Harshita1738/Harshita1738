ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate frontend developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on creating dynamic, responsive web applications. I enjoy solving problems through code and have built several projects that showcase my skills in user-centered design and development.

ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently expanding my expertise into backend development with Node.js and Django, aiming to become a versatile full-stack developer. I love participating in hackathons and collaborating on open-source projects, where I can learn new technologies and contribute to the community.

ðŸ’» Check out my repositories to see what Iâ€™m working on, and feel free to connect if youâ€™re interested in collaborating on exciting projects!
